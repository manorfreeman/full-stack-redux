App functionality
-given a collection of things to vote on, app will put items against each other in pairs
  -each round, people can vote for winner of that pair, so when only one item remaining, that is the winner

Architecture
-two apps: browser app (react) for UI, server for Node for voting logic
  -communicate via web sockets

Server App
-designing redux app begins by thinking about application state data structure
  -describes state of application at any time
-in redux, application state stored in one single tree structure
  -allows you to think about application state in isolation from aps behavior
  -state is pure data, and its all in one place
-initial state for our app might be just the collection of items that will be voted on (i.e. the collection entries)
-once first vote has begun, should have way to distinguish what is being voted on
  in this state, could have a vote entry in state holding pair of items currently under vote
